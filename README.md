The goal of this project is to create a fully functional calculator with various functions including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It will utilize css, html, and javascript to display and run all operations. 

Further work is needed on the modulo operator when is currently unfunctional. A strange bug also occurs after using the equals sign in which a user cannot input another operator before inputing a number. Basic formating could also be improved.
